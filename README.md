# Obesity_Riskü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# Dataset Description

#### Was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Obesity or CVD risk dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

##  Goal üôå

### ‚Ä¢ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èPerformed data cleaning and preprocessing on Obesity Risk ensuring data quality and integrity.

### ‚Ä¢ Predictive analysis to predict future Obesity Risk which is related to cardiovascular disease.

### ‚Ä¢ Show previous family history of overweight and its relationship to new obesity risk.
